# Amazon Sales Dashboard

## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps Amazon better understand its overall sales performance and customer purchase behavior. It helps the company know which customers are contributing the most to their sales, which products are selling the most, and how performance varies year by year. Through various metrics and sales figures, the company can identify its growth areas and weak points, and thus improve their strategy by recognizing these key areas.

Since a significant percentage of orders are returned, and shipping times vary across orders, it shows there is still scope for improvement in order handling and delivery processes.

Also, since year-wise sales trends fluctuate and a majority of profit comes from a small group of top customers and products, Amazon must focus on retaining these high-value contributors and improving offerings in lower-performing segments.


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a escel file.
- Step 2 : Open Power Query Editor and under the View tab in the Data Preview section, enable "Column distribution", "Column quality", and "Column profile" options.
- Step 3 : By default, profiling is done on the first 1000 rows. So, to get a full profile, select “Column profiling based on entire dataset.”
- Step 4 : It was observed that most columns had no missing or error values, but a few columns like "Return Status" contained null values.
- Step 5 : While calculating average shipping days, null values were ignored, as their percentage was low (less than 1%).
- Step 6 : In the report view, under the view tab, theme was selected.
- Step 7 :  Since the dataset included multiple metrics such as sales, quantity, and returns, appropriate visuals were added from the Visualizations pane.
-Step 8: Visual filters (Slicers) were added for fields such as Year to enable dynamic analysis.
- Step 9 : Four card visuals were added to the canvas, representing Sales Production, Product Units, KPI and Return respectively.

- Step 10 : A bar chart was also added to the report design area representing the number of sales in each segment. While creating this visual, field named "Sales" was also added to the Legends bucket, thus number of customers are also seggregated according the segment.

- Step 11: A donut chart was used to visualize sales in different region. 

- Step 12: A stacked column chart was created to represent top 10 customers who  made highest profit. Data was sorted in ascending order and top 10 values were selected using a Top N filter.

- Step 13: Two clustered bar charts were created for:

        Top 5 products by profit
        Bottom 5 products by profit
Sorting was applied on the "Profit" field, and Top N / Bottom N filters were used.

- Step 14: A map visual was used to show sales by geographical region. Map visual was customized using bubble markers.

- Step 15 : New measure was created to year in which order was placed.

Following DAX expression was written for the same,
        
        Year = Date.Year([Order Date])

- Step 16 : Calculated column was created in which, return was set to 1, if customer returned the product.

for creating new column following DAX expression was written;
       
        Return = 

        each if [Returned] = "Yes" then 1 else 0

Following inferences can be drawn from the dashboard;

### Sales performance improved year-over-year from 2012 to 2015.

        10% of the total revenue was generated by the top 5 customers.

        Product Advanced Copier, Cisco Smart phones and Samsung Smart Phones were the most sold items across all years.

        Average shipping time is 3 days, with some delays during holiday seasons.
